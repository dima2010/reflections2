When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    It is an extremely good idea to use a remote repository in case of collaboration with other people as well as remote deployment of a project code.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Since changes in the repository may be done by different people independently, it is a way better to keep the local repository update process more manageable.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are used to copy existing public repositories inside GitHub only. 
	Clones are used to copy existing private (i.e. your own repositories) from GitHub to the local machine or from one local destination to another.
	Branches are used to make a copy of all project files in order to make changes safely and independently of stable versions.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	First of all, it helps to know what the state of current branches are comparing to remotes. Secondly, it gives an ability to look at the development on remote branches independently of local ones.
