When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    It is an extremely good idea to use a remote repository in case of collaboration with other people as well as remote deployment of a project code.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Since changes in the repository may be done by different people independently, it is a way better to keep the local repository update process more manageable.
